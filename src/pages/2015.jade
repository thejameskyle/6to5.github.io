          ## Introduction

          ECMAScript 6 is the upcoming version of the ECMAScript standard.
          This standard is targeting ratification in June 2015. ES6 is a
          significant update to the language, and the first update to the
          language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of
          these features in major JavaScript engines is
          [underway now](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

          ## Transpiling

          ES6 will be an excellent upgrade, but browsers and JavaScript
          Engines have limited support. The solution is to transpile your
          source code.
